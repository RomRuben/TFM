## Experiment Design

- The execution time
- Memory consumption
- Tests with 5 queries the number of correct results obtained.
- Stress tests with [JMETER](http://jmeter.apache.org/) or [Gatling](http://gatling.io/)


I will use [Docker] (https://www.docker.com/) for a fast deploy of the infrastructure as elasticsearch, solr, and so on. Each one in a docker container.
